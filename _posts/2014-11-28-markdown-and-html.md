If you run and Dungeons & Dragons campaign—or are in one—and want to impress your adventuring companions by introducing a helpful, totally customizable Bot to your group discussions that you assembled yourself, skip to the bottom of this page and follow the provided link. If you want to read a little bit about why I acted the way I did, begin at the next paragraph. If you have no interest in either, I can’t help you. 
***Dungeons & Dragons (or really any table-top role-playing game)***
Like many of you, I play Dungeons & Dragons. A lot. Overtime, the names and roles of Non-Player Characters (NPCs) begin to bleed into each other, and when we run into Erolith drinking mead at The Boar’s Pajamas, I can’t remember if she is the blacksmith from Valenlon or the mayor of Grimwell. I am not an overly-organized person, so flipping through two different notebooks and checking over all the names and interactions scribbled in the margins of my last-three-levels-worth of character sheets was becoming tiresome. 
It was around this time that I learned about Discord Bots. All of the D&D games I am in use Discord for our default way of communicating with each other, and I was exploring other features. I immediately searched for D&D-related bots, and while I found some cool ones, I did not find what I was looking for, and so I decided to make my own. I had never made a bot before — or any app for that matter — so the first stages were really very chaotic, but Discord does a pretty good job of helping you get started. I called mine Roll-O-Dex, because puns are important, but you can call yours whatever you’d like. 
Most Discord Bots are available for anyone to invite to their server—mine is not. Instead, I have posted a guide to building your own bot using my code. It’s like Bot-IKEA. I decided to do it this way because:
* You get a chance to learn about how bots are built.
* You get a fully customizable bot (name it! change the logo! add new commands!) 
* I won’t have to worry about scaling and/or accidentally being charged for services I am not using.
* Neither will you. 
* It’s fun!
