BlocChat was my first time using Angular to create something on my own. Chatrooms, of course, already exist in plenty, but it was good practice for me to learn the framework while also working on my troubleshooting skills. I wanted to allow visitors to not only navigate various chatrooms on a single page, but also add content by creating new rooms and posts. I was able to do this, but recieved error notifications every step of the way, for typos, misplaced brackets, and forgotten links! Over this time I became quite the adept at navigating "Page Inspection" and "Ng-Inspector" for poetential errors. I also learned how to use cookies, using the information given at login to identify the source of new posts.
